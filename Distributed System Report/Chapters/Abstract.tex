%The efficient coordination of distributed systems hinges on the effective election of a leader to manage tasks and resources. This study aims to provide a comparative analysis of various leader election algorithms, focusing on their efficiency, performance, and scalability. The justification for this research lies in the critical role that leader election plays in maintaining system coherence and reliability. The central research question addresses which algorithms offer the best trade-offs between complexity and robustness in different distributed environments. The methodology involves a detailed examination and comparison of key algorithms such as the Bully Algorithm and the Ring Algorithm, among others, using both theoretical and practical performance metrics. Additionally, this study explores the evolving role of leader election in blockchain technology, highlighting its significance in ensuring decentralized consensus and maintaining the integrity of distributed ledgers. The conclusions illustrate how leader election algorithms have evolved from traditional distributed systems to modern applications, such as blockchain, significantly improving in efficiency and performance while addressing new challenges posed by decentralized and large-scale environments.
